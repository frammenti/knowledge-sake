SE.LPV.PRIM.SD.FE,Weighted average,"Ensuring that all students read with comprehension is essential to achieving the ambitious SDG targets and to building human capital. Children need to learn to read so that they can read to learn. Those who do not become proficient in reading by the end of primary school often cannot catch up later, because the curriculum of every school system assumes that secondary-school students can learn through reading. Reading is a gateway to all types of academic learning.  In high-income countries, 90% of all children learn to read with comprehension before the end of primary school, and for the highest-performing countries, the figure reaches 97% or more. Yet past evidence from many low- and middle-income countries has shown that many children are not learning to read with comprehension in primary school. 
The LP indicator illustrates progress toward SDG 4’s broader goal of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all. It particularly highlights progress towards SDG 4.1.1(b) and SDG 4.1.4, which specifies that all children attend primary school and reach at least a minimum proficiency level in reading at the end of primary. The indicator is also aligned with the World Bank’s Human Capital Project, which aims to ensure that children reach their full potential in school and in life. The ability to read with comprehension is a foundational skill that every education system around the world strives to impart by late in primary school—generally by age 10. Moreover, attaining the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in education requires first to achieving this basic building block, and so does improving countries’ Human Capital Index scores.",Female primary school age children out-of-school (%),CC BY-4.0,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by,"The enrollment for a given learning poverty release are not strictly comparable between countries, due to the differences in enrollment years and definitions, which are determined by best-match with the assessment year and data availability of enrollment indicators. 
The measure will also differ from out of school estimates using household survey data, which UIS reports for SDG 4.1.4. Households survey estimates are not used for Schooling Deprivation because data is typically reported for countries in various years and with time gaps. School surveys are more feasibly collected annually, while household data collection occurs every few years and can also depend on country demand. School surveys also allow more global consistency as the same survey and source data are used across countries. However, the source used to compute the total school-age population differ in some cases where a country provides their national estimates over the default UNDP population data. However, there are potential trade-offs in precision from school surveys as responses come from school representatives rather than using microdata.
Enrollment indicators are based on annual school surveys, but do not necessarily reflect actual attendance or dropout rates during the year. Also, enrolment rate (any definition) is affected by different age-reference points for enrollment. The length of education differs across countries and can influence enrollment rates, although the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) tries to minimize the difference. For example, a shorter duration for primary education tends to increase the rate; a longer one to decrease it (in part because older children are more at risk of dropping out). Moreover, age at enrollment may be inaccurately estimated or misstated, especially in communities where registration of births is not strictly enforced. The population data further affects the reference age.
Due to the limitations described, in some cases, country specialists will provide a data point that better reflects enrollment in the country.","The share of female children of primary-school age who are out of school or schooling deprived. This dimension is linked to the indicator 4.1.4 from the SDG 4 thematic framework. This element reflects the belief that all primary-age children should be learning in schools of some type, a belief that every country has enshrined in law and that is enshrined in the SDGs. In addition to fulfilling a universal right and serving as a necessary condition for sustained learning, schooling offers many benefits beyond learning. It contributes to children’s health and well-being such as promoting safety, nutrition, and socialization, and facilitating parents' labor market participation and, at the macro level, schooling can help build social cohesion, democracy, and peace. All those complementary functions mean that schooling has value over and above the measured cognitive learning that it leads to, and they justify including schooling deprivation in the concept of learning poverty.",,World Bank and UIS,"Schooling Deprivation is derived using enrollment rates computed by UIS using administrative records and follows the SDG 4.1.4 indicator. To ensure country coverage of data, we consider other enrollment definitions to use for learning poverty, if the first-best option is not available. 
We construct an enrollment dataset from 1990 to the year of the current release, relying on multiple enrollment definitions. Our dataset is constructed from UIS (UNESCO Institute of Statistics), and other sources suggested by World Bank regional or country education specialists. Data sources are typically from administrative records (school registers or school censuses) for data on enrolment by age, and UNPD population estimates for school-age population (UIS). Enrolment by single years of age in all levels of education and the total primary-school-age population are used to compute enrollment rates.
We follow this hierarchy of enrollment definitions: Country specialist validated data > Adjusted Net Enrollment Rate (ANER) > Total Net Enrollment Rate (TNER) > Net enrollment rate (NER) > Gross Enrollment Rate (GER; if the gross enrollment rate is higher than 100%, it is adjusted to be 100%).
Our preferred measure of school participation is ANER, because it accounts for some primary school aged children who might enter primary school early and advance to secondary school before they reach the official upper age limit of primary education. Adjusted net enrollment is a measure of both “stock” and “flow” and accounts for both age- and grade-based distortions, as it is the percent of primary school age children enrolled either in primary or secondary education, as opposed to gross enrollment which is the share of children of any age that are enrolled in primary school, or net enrollment which is the share of primary school age children that are enrolled in primary school. The next-best indicator is used if ANER is unavailable. In some cases, country specialists will provide a data point that reflects enrollment in the country better than UIS statistics which is used. In future Learning Poverty releases, the enrollment hierarchy may be adjusted as availability of indicator definitions change. 
The enrollment year used is the one that best pairs with the assessment year used to compute Learning Deprivation. The year of the preferred assessment is the base. If the same enrollment year is not available, we use a step function to fill the data in with the value of the closest year. If there is data available for two years equally close to the year to fill, the older value is used. This procedure to extrapolate enrollment for missing values is required for us to pair the proficiency measure with enrollment measures from the same year, or its best proxy when enrollment is not available for the same year of the assessment.",Education: Outcomes,The share of female children of primary-school age who are out of school.,% of Total

Low GAML threshold,CC BY-4.0,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by,"The process of equating proficiency levels on different assessments to the GAML definition is not straightforward. Even the long-running regional assessment initiatives like PASEC (West and Central Africa) and LLECE (Latin America and the Caribbean) use different definitions and a different number of levels than other assessments like PIRLS, and those might not even be the same over time. Their test development methodologies and test administration procedures also vary. Moreover, because not all countries participate in global or regional assessments, for some major countries we rely on their interim reporting using their national assessments; equating these assessments is even more challenging. UIS and the World Bank have mapped how proficiency levels between assessment can equate to one another, but they are not strictly comparable. 
Among the differences across assessments, one important point concerns the age at which children are tested. The reference age for our exercise is age 10. However, all learning assessments used in this analysis are sampled based on specific grades rather than age. PIRLS and TIMSS are administered in Grade 4, meaning that the average student assessed is indeed 10 years old, but this is not the case for the regional assessments. PASEC and LLECE are administered in Grade 6, so the average age in those assessments is 12.8 and 12.4, respectively. National assessments are administered at different grades, so to incorporate those assessments, we chose for each country the grade between 4 and 6 (inclusive) for which relevant and reliable data were available. This is consistent with the SDG monitoring by UIS and GAML, which lists “End of Primary (or Grades 4 to 6)” as the relevant age category for the end-of-primary students (SDG 4.1.1b).
In some cases, National Learning Assessments that have not been policy linked are used for learning poverty, if country teams and experts determine that an assessment is of sufficiently quality or has undertaken steps to align their assessments with the Global Proficiency Framework. They will often be reported as interim learning poverty indicators, as they are not fully aligned with SDG 4.1.1b.","The share of female pupils at the end of primary schooling who are below the minimum proficiency level (MPL) for reading or learning deprived. The MPL in reading at the end of primary is defined by the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML), measured in standard learning assessments, and reported in the context of the SDG 4.1.1b monitoring. It is “Students independently and fluently read simple, short narrative and expository texts. They locate explicitly-stated information. They interpret and give some explanations about the key ideas in these texts. They provide simple, personal opinions or judgements about the information, events and characters in a text.” (UIS and GAML 2019). In other words, a child “attaining” minimum proficiency has the ability to read and understand a short passage of age-appropriate material, whether a simple story or non-fiction narrative of a few paragraphs. In addition to this nutshell statement, the GAML has also proposed a common terminology to describe classifications in the context of the MPL. This is a critical first step toward linking cross-national and national learning assessments with a common benchmark.",,World Bank and UIS,"Learning assessments used to calculate Learning Poverty have a minimum proficiency level (MPL) benchmarked by Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML) under the leadership of the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS), which occurred within the reporting window. To operationalize this concept, the current SDG monitoring process is followed by defining “proficiency” as reaching at least the Low International Benchmark on the international PIRLS literacy assessment. 
PIRLS is the major global primary-age assessment focused on reading, and if all countries participated in it, the task of constructing global estimates of minimum proficiency would be trivial, as it would require aggregating results from a single cross-national assessment. However, most countries participating in PIRLS are high-income, and only a small minority of low- and middle-income countries participate in the assessment. One of the main contributions of the GAML process is that it has overcome this data gap by benchmarking several major cross-national assessments—and increasingly national learning assessments as well—against the standard. 
The MPL for each learning assessment is used to calculate the reading proficiency rate for that country, which is the share of students scoring at or above the minimum proficiency level, and conversely to calculate the learning deprivation.
The Proficiency and Grade Levels used for each assessment is as follows: PIRLS (grade 4) - Level 2 (Low international benchmark, 400 points); TIMSS (grade 4) - Level 2 (Low international benchmark, 400 points); LLECE (SERCE, grade 6) - Level 3 (513.66 points); PASEC (grades 5 and 6) - Level 4 (595.1 points); SEA-PLM (grade 5) - Level 6 and above; National Learning Assessment (grade 4, 5 and 6) - Varies by country. 
When a given country had administered multiple types of learning assessments, a hierarchy is applied in the order listed below to ensure best comparability across countries: International or Regional Learning Assessment for Reading (PIRLS, LLECE, PASEC, SEA-PLM) > TIMSS Science > Statistical or Pairwise Linking Exercises > AMPL-bs, Policy Linked National Learning Assessments or Policy Linked Service Delivery Indicators (SDIs) > Non-Policy Linked NLAs (Interim Reporting).

Children need to learn to read so that they can read to learn. Those who do not become proficient in reading by the end of primary school often cannot catch up later, because the curriculum of every school system assumes that secondary-school students can learn through reading. Reading is a gateway to all types of academic learning.  In high-income countries, 90% of all children learn to read with comprehension before the end of primary school, and for the highest-performing countries, the figure reaches 97% or more. Yet past evidence from many low- and middle-income countries has shown that many children are not learning to read with comprehension in primary school.

The ability to read with comprehension is a foundational skill that every education system around the world strives to impart by late in primary school—generally by age 10.

To achieve it, not only should all children be reading proficiently after 3 full years in primary education, but they should also have entered school at age 6 or 7. 
By contrast, the actual indicators used to measure learning poverty are based on grade rather than age. Since the assessments are of 4th- through 6th-graders, the children tested will have had at least 3 to 5 years in school to reach what, according to the ideal, should 10 be an age-10 minimum proficiency, or even the entire primary-school-age segment for the out-of-school indicator.
Due to different assessment availability within and between countries, data comparability, both within countries over time and across countries still poses a significant challenge. The additional out of school component further limits comparability.
The learning poverty indicator is based on data covering four-fifths of children at the end of primary school. In other words, a little more than 80 percent of children in low- and middle-income countries live in a country with at least one learning assessment at the end of primary, carried out in the past 9 years. For regional and global aggregates, weighted imputations affect regions with less data coverage. The major gaps are concentrated in countries where the learning crisis is most acute. Less than half of children in Sub-Saharan Africa live in a country with a National Large-Scale Learning Assessment (NLSA) or a international of regional large-scale learning assessment (ILSA or RLSA) of adequate quality to be used for this purpose.
This extensive coverage became possible only in recent years, with the progress in measuring learning in countries and the GAML’s efforts to establish comparability, which has made possible the construction of a global indicator based on harmonized proficiency levels.

Children need to learn to read so that they can read to learn. Those who do not become proficient in reading by the end of primary school often cannot catch up later, because the curriculum of every school system assumes that secondary-school students can learn through reading. Reading is a gateway to all types of academic learning.  In high-income countries, 90% of all children learn to read with comprehension before the end of primary school, and for the highest-performing countries, the figure reaches 97% or more.

The measure will also differ from out of school estimates using household survey data, which UIS reports for SDG 4.1.4. Households survey estimates are not used for Schooling Deprivation because data is typically reported for countries in various years and with time gaps. School surveys are more feasibly collected annually, while household data collection occurs every few years and can also depend on country demand. School surveys also allow more global consistency as the same survey and source data are used across countries. However, the source used to compute the total school-age population differ in some cases where a country provides their national estimates over the default UNDP population data. However, there are potential trade-offs in precision from school surveys as responses come from school representatives rather than using microdata.
Enrollment indicators are based on annual school surveys, but do not necessarily reflect actual attendance or dropout rates during the year. Also, enrolment rate (any definition) is affected by different age-reference points for enrollment. The length of education differs across countries and can influence enrollment rates, although the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) tries to minimize the difference. For example, a shorter duration for primary education tends to increase the rate; a longer one to decrease it (in part because older children are more at risk of dropping out). Moreover, age at enrollment may be inaccurately estimated or misstated, especially in communities where registration of births is not strictly enforced. The population data further affects the reference age.
Due to the limitations described, in some cases, country specialists will provide a data point that better reflects enrollment in the country.","The share of male children of primary-school age who are out of school or schooling deprived. This dimension is linked to the indicator 4.1.4 from the SDG 4 thematic framework. This element reflects the belief that all primary-age children should be learning in schools of some type, a belief that every country has enshrined in law and that is enshrined in the SDGs. In addition to fulfilling a universal right and serving as a necessary condition for sustained learning, schooling offers many benefits beyond learning. It contributes to children’s health and well-being such as promoting safety, nutrition, and socialization, and facilitating parents' labor market participation and, at the macro level, schooling can help build social cohesion, democracy, and peace. All those complementary functions mean that schooling has value over and above the measured cognitive learning that it leads to, and they justify including schooling deprivation in the concept of learning poverty.",,World Bank and UIS,"Schooling Deprivation is derived using enrollment rates computed by UIS using administrative records and follows the SDG 4.1.4 indicator. To ensure country coverage of data, we consider other enrollment definitions to use for learning poverty, if the first-best option is not available. 
We construct an enrollment dataset from 1990 to the year of the current release, relying on multiple enrollment definitions. Our dataset is constructed from UIS (UNESCO Institute of Statistics), and other sources suggested by World Bank regional or country education specialists. Data sources are typically from administrative records (school registers or school censuses) for data on enrolment by age, and UNPD population estimates for school-age population (UIS). Enrolment by single years of age in all levels of education and the total primary-school-age population are used to compute enrollment rates.
We follow this hierarchy of enrollment definitions: Country specialist validated data > Adjusted Net Enrollment Rate (ANER) > Total Net Enrollment Rate (TNER) > Net enrollment rate (NER) > Gross Enrollment Rate (GER; if the gross enrollment rate is higher than 100%, it is adjusted to be 100%).
Our preferred measure of school participation is ANER, because it accounts for some primary school aged children who might enter primary school early and advance to secondary school before they reach the official upper age limit of primary education. Adjusted net enrollment is a measure of both “stock” and “flow” and accounts for both age- and grade-based distortions, as it is the percent of primary school age children enrolled either in primary or secondary education, as opposed to gross enrollment which is the share of children of any age that are enrolled in primary school, or net enrollment which is the share of primary school age children that are enrolled in primary school. The next-best indicator is used if ANER is unavailable. In some cases, country specialists will provide a data point that reflects enrollment in the country better than UIS statistics which is used. In future Learning Poverty releases, the enrollment hierarchy may be adjusted as availability of indicator definitions change. 
The enrollment year used is the one that best pairs with the assessment year used to compute Learning Deprivation. The year of the preferred assessment is the base. If the same enrollment year is not available, we use a step function to fill the data in with the value of the closest year. If there is data available for two years equally close to the year to fill, the older value is used. This procedure to extrapolate enrollment for missing values is required for us to pair the proficiency measure with enrollment measures from the same year, or its best proxy when enrollment is not available for the same year of the assessment.",Education: Outcomes,The share of male children of primary-school age who are out of school.,% of Total

Low GAML threshold,CC BY-4.0,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by,"The process of equating proficiency levels on different assessments to the GAML definition is not straightforward. Even the long-running regional assessment initiatives like PASEC (West and Central Africa) and LLECE (Latin America and the Caribbean) use different definitions and a different number of levels than other assessments like PIRLS, and those might not even be the same over time. Their test development methodologies and test administration procedures also vary. Moreover, because not all countries participate in global or regional assessments, for some major countries we rely on their interim reporting using their national assessments; equating these assessments is even more challenging. UIS and the World Bank have mapped how proficiency levels between assessment can equate to one another, but they are not strictly comparable. 
Among the differences across assessments, one important point concerns the age at which children are tested. The reference age for our exercise is age 10. However, all learning assessments used in this analysis are sampled based on specific grades rather than age. PIRLS and TIMSS are administered in Grade 4, meaning that the average student assessed is indeed 10 years old, but this is not the case for the regional assessments. PASEC and LLECE are administered in Grade 6, so the average age in those assessments is 12.8 and 12.4, respectively. National assessments are administered at different grades, so to incorporate those assessments, we chose for each country the grade between 4 and 6 (inclusive) for which relevant and reliable data were available. This is consistent with the SDG monitoring by UIS and GAML, which lists “End of Primary (or Grades 4 to 6)” as the relevant age category for the end-of-primary students (SDG 4.1.1b).
In some cases, National Learning Assessments that have not been policy linked are used for learning poverty, if country teams and experts determine that an assessment is of sufficiently quality or has undertaken steps to align their assessments with the Global Proficiency Framework. They will often be reported as interim learning poverty indicators, as they are not fully aligned with SDG 4.1.1b.","The share of male pupils at the end of primary schooling who are below the minimum proficiency level (MPL) for reading or learning deprived. The MPL in reading at the end of primary is defined by the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML), measured in standard learning assessments, and reported in the context of the SDG 4.1.1b monitoring. It is “Students independently and fluently read simple, short narrative and expository texts. They locate explicitly-stated information. They interpret and give some explanations about the key ideas in these texts. They provide simple, personal opinions or judgements about the information, events and characters in a text.” (UIS and GAML 2019). In other words, a child “attaining” minimum proficiency has the ability to read and understand a short passage of age-appropriate material, whether a simple story or non-fiction narrative of a few paragraphs. In addition to this nutshell statement, the GAML has also proposed a common terminology to describe classifications in the context of the MPL. This is a critical first step toward linking cross-national and national learning assessments with a common benchmark.",,World Bank and UIS,"Learning assessments used to calculate Learning Poverty have a minimum proficiency level (MPL) benchmarked by Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML) under the leadership of the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS), which occurred within the reporting window. To operationalize this concept, the current SDG monitoring process is followed by defining “proficiency” as reaching at least the Low International Benchmark on the international PIRLS literacy assessment. 
PIRLS is the major global primary-age assessment focused on reading, and if all countries participated in it, the task of constructing global estimates of minimum proficiency would be trivial, as it would require aggregating results from a single cross-national assessment. However, most countries participating in PIRLS are high-income, and only a small minority of low- and middle-income countries participate in the assessment. One of the main contributions of the GAML process is that it has overcome this data gap by benchmarking several major cross-national assessments—and increasingly national learning assessments as well—against the standard. 
The MPL for each learning assessment is used to calculate the reading proficiency rate for that country, which is the share of students scoring at or above the minimum proficiency level, and conversely to calculate the learning deprivation.
The Proficiency and Grade Levels used for each assessment is as follows: PIRLS (grade 4) - Level 2 (Low international benchmark, 400 points); TIMSS (grade 4) - Level 2 (Low international benchmark, 400 points); LLECE (SERCE, grade 6) - Level 3 (513.66 points); PASEC (grades 5 and 6) - Level 4 (595.1 points); SEA-PLM (grade 5) - Level 6 and above; National Learning Assessment (grade 4, 5 and 6) - Varies by country. 
When a given country had administered multiple types of learning assessments, a hierarchy is applied in the order listed below to ensure best comparability across countries: International or Regional Learning Assessment for Reading (PIRLS, LLECE, PASEC, SEA-PLM) > TIMSS Science > Statistical or Pairwise Linking Exercises > AMPL-bs, Policy Linked National Learning Assessments or Policy Linked Service Delivery Indicators (SDIs) > Non-Policy Linked NLAs (Interim Reporting).
Note that as the GAML and joint coalitions continue their efforts to improve learning data coverage, the hierarchy may be revised.",Education: Outcomes,The share of male pupils at the end of primary schooling who are below the minimum proficiency level (MPL) for reading.,% of Total

SE.LPV.PRIM.SD,Weighted average,"Ensuring that all students read with comprehension is essential to achieving the ambitious SDG targets and to building human capital. Children need to learn to read so that they can read to learn. Those who do not become proficient in reading by the end of primary school often cannot catch up later, because the curriculum of every school system assumes that secondary-school students can learn through reading. Reading is a gateway to all types of academic learning.  In high-income countries, 90% of all children learn to read with comprehension before the end of primary school, and for the highest-performing countries, the figure reaches 97% or more. Yet past evidence from many low- and middle-income countries has shown that many children are not learning to read with comprehension in primary school. 
The LP indicator illustrates progress toward SDG 4’s broader goal of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all. It particularly highlights progress towards SDG 4.1.1(b) and SDG 4.1.4, which specifies that all children attend primary school and reach at least a minimum proficiency level in reading at the end of primary. The indicator is also aligned with the World Bank’s Human Capital Project, which aims to ensure that children reach their full potential in school and in life. The ability to read with comprehension is a foundational skill that every education system around the world strives to impart by late in primary school—generally by age 10. Moreover, attaining the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in education requires first to achieving this basic building block, and so does improving countries’ Human Capital Index scores.",Primary school age children out-of-school (%),CC BY-4.0,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by,"The enrollment for a given learning poverty release are not strictly comparable between countries, due to the differences in enrollment years and definitions, which are determined by best-match with the assessment year and data availability of enrollment indicators. 
The measure will also differ from out of school estimates using household survey data, which UIS reports for SDG 4.1.4. Households survey estimates are not used for Schooling Deprivation because data is typically reported for countries in various years and with time gaps. School surveys are more feasibly collected annually, while household data collection occurs every few years and can also depend on country demand. School surveys also allow more global consistency as the same survey and source data are used across countries. However, the source used to compute the total school-age population differ in some cases where a country provides their national estimates over the default UNDP population data. However, there are potential trade-offs in precision from school surveys as responses come from school representatives rather than using microdata.
Enrollment indicators are based on annual school surveys, but do not necessarily reflect actual attendance or dropout rates during the year. Also, enrolment rate (any definition) is affected by different age-reference points for enrollment. The length of education differs across countries and can influence enrollment rates, although the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) tries to minimize the difference. For example, a shorter duration for primary education tends to increase the rate; a longer one to decrease it (in part because older children are more at risk of dropping out). Moreover, age at enrollment may be inaccurately estimated or misstated, especially in communities where registration of births is not strictly enforced. The population data further affects the reference age.
Due to the limitations described, in some cases, country specialists will provide a data point that better reflects enrollment in the country.","The share of children of primary-school age who are out of school or schooling deprived. This dimension is linked to the indicator 4.1.4 from the SDG 4 thematic framework. This element reflects the belief that all primary-age children should be learning in schools of some type, a belief that every country has enshrined in law and that is enshrined in the SDGs. In addition to fulfilling a universal right and serving as a necessary condition for sustained learning, schooling offers many benefits beyond learning. It contributes to children’s health and well-being such as promoting safety, nutrition, and socialization, and facilitating parents' labor market participation and, at the macro level, schooling can help build social cohesion, democracy, and peace. All those complementary functions mean that schooling has value over and above the measured cognitive learning that it leads to, and they justify including schooling deprivation in the concept of learning poverty.",,World Bank and UIS,"Schooling Deprivation is derived using enrollment rates computed by UIS using administrative records and follows the SDG 4.1.4 indicator. To ensure country coverage of data, we consider other enrollment definitions to use for learning poverty, if the first-best option is not available. 
We construct an enrollment dataset from 1990 to the year of the current release, relying on multiple enrollment definitions. Our dataset is constructed from UIS (UNESCO Institute of Statistics), and other sources suggested by World Bank regional or country education specialists. Data sources are typically from administrative records (school registers or school censuses) for data on enrolment by age, and UNPD population estimates for school-age population (UIS). Enrolment by single years of age in all levels of education and the total primary-school-age population are used to compute enrollment rates.
We follow this hierarchy of enrollment definitions: Country specialist validated data > Adjusted Net Enrollment Rate (ANER) > Total Net Enrollment Rate (TNER) > Net enrollment rate (NER) > Gross Enrollment Rate (GER; if the gross enrollment rate is higher than 100%, it is adjusted to be 100%).
Our preferred measure of school participation is ANER, because it accounts for some primary school aged children who might enter primary school early and advance to secondary school before they reach the official upper age limit of primary education. Adjusted net enrollment is a measure of both “stock” and “flow” and accounts for both age- and grade-based distortions, as it is the percent of primary school age children enrolled either in primary or secondary education, as opposed to gross enrollment which is the share of children of any age that are enrolled in primary school, or net enrollment which is the share of primary school age children that are enrolled in primary school. The next-best indicator is used if ANER is unavailable. In some cases, country specialists will provide a data point that reflects enrollment in the country better than UIS statistics which is used. In future Learning Poverty releases, the enrollment hierarchy may be adjusted as availability of indicator definitions change. 
The enrollment year used is the one that best pairs with the assessment year used to compute Learning Deprivation. The year of the preferred assessment is the base. If the same enrollment year is not available, we use a step function to fill the data in with the value of the closest year. If there is data available for two years equally close to the year to fill, the older value is used. This procedure to extrapolate enrollment for missing values is required for us to pair the proficiency measure with enrollment measures from the same year, or its best proxy when enrollment is not available for the same year of the assessment.",Education: Outcomes,The share of children of primary-school age who are out of school.,% of Total

Even the long-running regional assessment initiatives like PASEC (West and Central Africa) and LLECE (Latin America and the Caribbean) use different definitions and a different number of levels than other assessments like PIRLS, and those might not even be the same over time. Their test development methodologies and test administration procedures also vary. Moreover, because not all countries participate in global or regional assessments, for some major countries we rely on their interim reporting using their national assessments; equating these assessments is even more challenging. UIS and the World Bank have mapped how proficiency levels between assessment can equate to one another, but they are not strictly comparable. 
Among the differences across assessments, one important point concerns the age at which children are tested. The reference age for our exercise is age 10. However, all learning assessments used in this analysis are sampled based on specific grades rather than age. PIRLS and TIMSS are administered in Grade 4, meaning that the average student assessed is indeed 10 years old, but this is not the case for the regional assessments. PASEC and LLECE are administered in Grade 6, so the average age in those assessments is 12.8 and 12.4, respectively. National assessments are administered at different grades, so to incorporate those assessments, we chose for each country the grade between 4 and 6 (inclusive) for which relevant and reliable data were available. This is consistent with the SDG monitoring by UIS and GAML, which lists “End of Primary (or Grades 4 to 6)” as the relevant age category for the end-of-primary students (SDG 4.1.1b).
In some cases, National Learning Assessments that have not been policy linked are used for learning poverty, if country teams and experts determine that an assessment is of sufficiently quality or has undertaken steps to align their assessments with the Global Proficiency Framework. They will often be reported as interim learning poverty indicators, as they are not fully aligned with SDG 4.1.1b.","The share of pupils at the end of primary schooling who are below the minimum proficiency level (MPL) for reading or learning deprived. The MPL in reading at the end of primary is defined by the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML), measured in standard learning assessments, and reported in the context of the SDG 4.1.1b monitoring. It is “Students independently and fluently read simple, short narrative and expository texts. They locate explicitly-stated information. They interpret and give some explanations about the key ideas in these texts. They provide simple, personal opinions or judgements about the information, events and characters in a text.” (UIS and GAML 2019). In other words, a child “attaining” minimum proficiency has the ability to read and understand a short passage of age-appropriate material, whether a simple story or non-fiction narrative of a few paragraphs. In addition to this nutshell statement, the GAML has also proposed a common terminology to describe classifications in the context of the MPL. This is a critical first step toward linking cross-national and national learning assessments with a common benchmark.",,World Bank and UIS,"Learning assessments used to calculate Learning Poverty have a minimum proficiency level (MPL) benchmarked by Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML) under the leadership of the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS), which occurred within the reporting window. To operationalize this concept, the current SDG monitoring process is followed by defining “proficiency” as reaching at least the Low International Benchmark on the international PIRLS literacy assessment. 
PIRLS is the major global primary-age assessment focused on reading, and if all countries participated in it, the task of constructing global estimates of minimum proficiency would be trivial, as it would require aggregating results from a single cross-national assessment. However, most countries participating in PIRLS are high-income, and only a small minority of low- and middle-income countries participate in the assessment. One of the main contributions of the GAML process is that it has overcome this data gap by benchmarking several major cross-national assessments—and increasingly national learning assessments as well—against the standard. 
The MPL for each learning assessment is used to calculate the reading proficiency rate for that country, which is the share of students scoring at or above the minimum proficiency level, and conversely to calculate the learning deprivation.
The Proficiency and Grade Levels used for each assessment is as follows: PIRLS (grade 4) - Level 2 (Low international benchmark, 400 points); TIMSS (grade 4) - Level 2 (Low international benchmark, 400 points); LLECE (SERCE, grade 6) - Level 3 (513.66 points); PASEC (grades 5 and 6) - Level 4 (595.1 points); SEA-PLM (grade 5) - Level 6 and above; National Learning Assessment (grade 4, 5 and 6) - Varies by country. 
When a given country had administered multiple types of learning assessments, a hierarchy is applied in the order listed below to ensure best comparability across countries: International or Regional Learning Assessment for Reading (PIRLS, LLECE, PASEC, SEA-PLM) > TIMSS Science > Statistical or Pairwise Linking Exercises > AMPL-bs, Policy Linked National Learning Assessments or Policy Linked Service Delivery Indicators (SDIs) > Non-Policy Linked NLAs (Interim Reporting).
Note that as the GAML and joint coalitions continue their efforts to improve learning data coverage, the hierarchy may be revised.",Education: Outcomes,The share of pupils at the end of primary schooling who are below the minimum proficiency level (MPL) for reading.,% of Total
