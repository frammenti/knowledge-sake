# Knowledge for Knowledge's Sake

This repository holds the documentation and code for the course project on [Open Access and Digital Ethics](https://www.unibo.it/en/study/phd-professional-masters-specialisation-schools-and-other-programmes/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2024/424645), University of Bologna, a.y. 2024/2025.

The aim of the project is to investigate how socio-cultural and economic inequalities influence individual access to knowledge and shape avenues for personal growth in STEM and Humanities fields. Covering European Union countries from 2000 to 2022, the project combines OECD PISA scores in mathematics and reading comprehension with EU labor force statistics to provide data-driven insights into educational and career fulfillment opportunities.
